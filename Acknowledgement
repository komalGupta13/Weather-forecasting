Weather Forecasting with Python Using Data Science
Weather forecasting is a crucial application of data science, using historical and real-time data to predict future weather conditions. In Python, this involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

Steps Involved:
1.Data Collection
Use APIs like OpenWeatherMap, NOAA, or Kaggle datasets.
Collect temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure data.

2.Data Preprocessing
Clean missing values, remove outliers, and normalize data.
Convert date-time features for better modeling.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
Identify seasonality and correlations.

4.Feature Engineering
Create meaningful features like moving averages, humidity trends, or pressure changes.
Use feature selection techniques for optimization.

5.Model Selection & Training
Machine Learning Models:
Linear Regression (for temperature prediction)
Decision Trees, Random Forest, or XGBoost
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Deep Learning Models:
LSTMs or GRUs (for time-series forecasting)
CNNs for spatial weather pattern recognition

6.Evaluation & Optimization
Use RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or Bayesian Optimization.

7.Deployment
Use Flask or FastAPI to create a web-based weather forecast app.
Deploy on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.

Libraries Used:
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
APIs & Deployment: Requests, Flask, FastAPI
